All national extensions are sub-categories of a core time period code, so can be mapped back to a standard period. National extensions can be assigned by any user, and are not exclusive to users in the indicated country. TIME PERIOD qualifiers are usually used in conjunction with PLACE 1* qualifiers. (Specific historical events or individual years would be conveyed in detail elsewhere in a products metadata, for example by the title, the table of contents, the descriptive text or keywords). DO NOT USE: for indicating the year of an annual or road atlas or travel guide or the year a work was originally published in, (this is described in other metadata).
